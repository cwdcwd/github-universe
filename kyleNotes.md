## We are the Man

Chris Wanstrath the CEO of Github opened his keynote with a conversation about the genesis of github and the first commit on github/github over nine years ago. He also said "... We are the Man, and we know it".  Actually it was Nichole Sanchez VP marketing and she said "We [open source] are the establishment now.." but I thought it also applied  to Github.   It is  both  cool and ironic, given this perpetual startup's product is now embedded deep in almost every fortune 500.   It is funny to think that this term, which has always been associated with an oppressive, authoritative  organization, is now being, self associated, with and organization that keeps us honest, helps us see where we came from,  and helps us collaborative in way that mankind has never seen before.

## The Museum of Open source

Nichole told a story about visiting the National Mall in DC and seeing signs that see "Free and open to the public". She drew the parallel that gitHub was the Museum of open source and I love that analog.  When I learned to code most software and  tool needed to be licensed, i.e. paid for, and it wasn't cheap.

## Git time machine

The most impressive atom plugin was git-time machine. It shows a graphical time line along the bottom and has dots on the timeline whose size corresponds to the relative number of lines that were changed.  If you hoover over these bubbles, a color diff shows up in the right hand pane.

## Operation Code

David Molina, a former Army Captain, gave a compelling story about starting a software mentoring and code school  for military veterans.  David started [Operation Code](https://operationcode.org/) due to the fact that the GI bill did not cover coding education.  I have been looking for a way to give back for quite a while and [Operation Code](https://operationcode.org/) seems like a great opportunity to say thank you for your service.  I  joined and have been invited to the Operation Code Slack channel, it is an awesome community with currently 2 channels.
