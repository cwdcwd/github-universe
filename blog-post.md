### Electron apps!

### GraphQL
This is by far my favourite topic from the event. GraphQL is a brand new way of thinking around data querying and manipulation. The core concept being that we should have less rigid RESTful interfaces and datamodels and instead focus more on thinking about the "graph" of information as it aligns to the products we're building.

### Tips & Tricks!
To me, one of the greatest things about git is that there's always something to learn. A new techinque, a flow pattern, or even just a simple CLI flag that I had _no_ idea about but changes the game for me on a day to day basis. Here's a couple:

- git CLI 
  + `git grep`: grep search your repo!
  + `git log --graph --full-history --all --color --pretty=format:"%x1b[31m%h%x09%x1b[32m%d%x1b[0m%x20%s"`: amazing pretty print log graph
- Atom IDE
  + `alt-g`: change marker showing a marker on lines changed
  +
